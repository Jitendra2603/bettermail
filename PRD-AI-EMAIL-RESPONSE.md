# AI-Powered Email Response System PRD

## Overview
An AI-powered system that automatically generates contextually aware email responses by analyzing email threads, attachments, and historical communications. The system uses advanced AI models to understand content and generate appropriate responses while maintaining user control over the final output.

## Core Features

### 1. Automated Response Generation
- Trigger: New email received or reply in thread
- Exclude: User's own messages
- Models:
  - GPT-4: Text analysis and response generation
  - GPT-4 Vision: Image content analysis
  - LlamaParse: PDF and document parsing
- Rate Limiting:
  - Implement per-user quotas
  - Track API usage and costs

### 2. Content Processing
- Email Thread Analysis:
  - Extract full conversation context
  - Maintain thread hierarchy
  - Process inline images
- Attachment Handling:
  - Images: GPT-4 Vision analysis
  - PDFs: LlamaParse text extraction
  - Other documents: Format-specific parsing
- Content Restrictions:
  - Max file size limits
  - Allowed file types
  - Security scanning

### 3. Knowledge Management
- Vector Database:
  - Store embeddings for all content
  - Metadata indexing
  - Fast similarity search
- Context Organization:
  - Per-user sections
  - Attachment categorization
  - Automatic metadata generation
- Search & Retrieval:
  - Semantic search
  - Relevance scoring
  - Attachment linking

### 4. User Interface

#### Message Display
- AI Response Presentation:
  - Distinct visual style
  - Attachment previews
  - Source attribution
- Interaction Controls:
  - Double-tap to edit
  - Reaction system integration
  - Quick actions menu

#### Context Page (/context)
- Layout:
  - User-based sections
  - Expandable content areas
  - Visual attachment gallery
- Content Display:
  - Metadata visualization
  - Content previews
  - Relevance indicators
- Management Tools:
  - Upload interface
  - Organization controls
  - Search functionality

### 5. Graph RAG System
- Components:
  - Vector store integration
  - Query processing engine
  - Relevance scoring
  - Document retrieval
- Features:
  - Local context search
  - Global knowledge base
  - Hybrid search modes
- Integration:
  - Reaction-based triggers
  - Automatic attachment linking
  - Context enhancement

## User Flow

1. Email Reception
   - System receives new email
   - Triggers content processing
   - Generates embeddings

2. AI Analysis
   - Process email thread
   - Analyze attachments
   - Generate response

3. User Interface
   - Display AI suggestion
   - Show relevant attachments
   - Present editing options

4. User Interaction
   - Review suggestion
   - Edit if needed
   - Approve via reaction

5. Response Enhancement
   - Global context search (heart reaction)
   - Attach relevant documents
   - Update suggestion

## Technical Implementation

### Storage Structure
